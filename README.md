Easy way to quickly create a plotly chart as a Composite.

Use MainBuilder class to create a complexe chart, use a fast_chart class to quickly build a specific type chart (more detail in doc).

Import "d3.min.js", "plotly.js", "plotlyGraph.js" and "plotlyFast.js" in WebContent/js.

Import the "json" folder in the user working directory.

Version:
- 3.1 : multi-2D type chart added to main builder.
- 3.2 : function getSelectedData() of MainBuilder and PlotlyScatter now return Map<String, List<String>>.
